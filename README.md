# About

The shh BOT is a Discord bot made in [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) that locks you from sending messages in a chat, and every time you try to do it, you get ratio'ed and roasted.

# Commands

`setar canal (channel id)` - Sets the bot's functionality to this channel<p></p>
`coloca eles no chinelo` - Starts doing it's thing<p></p>
`para com isso` - Stop doing it's thing<p></p>

# How to use it

You'll have to clone this repository, and run `index.py` by yourself. Unfortunately, you'll have to modificate my ID on the code (i didn't code in administrator permissions yet), so you can use the bot.<p></p>
After cloning this repository, head in `token.py.example`, fill in with the token of your bot, and rename the file to `token.py`, and after installing [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py), you should be ready to start the bot.<p></p>
With it running, set the channel using `setar canal (channel id)`<p></p>

# WIP
- Between guilds compatibility (each instance works with only one channel in one guild);
- Permissions;
- Polishing, tt is really, REALLY, **REALLY** slow.

# Disclaimer
This is a meme bot and it is barely coded well, so please, don't take it seriously.
